# Mongo-DB-users-thoughts-API

## Description
    This application uses MongoDB to hold information for a social network that the users themselves can create. The addition of users having the ability to create a friends list or react to friends thoughts makes this application a little more complex. This concept is something that is widely used in popular social networking platforms. I have enjoyed the creation of this application, and I feel like I have learned a lot up to this point. I gained a strong understanding of controllers and routes working together. I hope that the comments I have left throughout this code will help guide you through it.

## Installation
    
To use this application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your desktop. Once in your code editor of choice, you will need to open your terminal and initialize npm with the command `npm init`. Once you have npm initialized, you will install npm with the command `npm install`. There are only two dependencies that you need to install for this application, mongoose and express. To install these dependencies you will use the command `npm i mongoose express`. In order to install nodemon, you will need to use the command: `npm i -D nodemon`.
            
## Usage
    
This application is used to create a social network for users including the ability to add friends, thoughts, and reactions to those thoughts. Once the user starts the server, they are able use get requests to view all users and thoughts, or use a specific user/thought ID to view a single user/thought. They will also be able to create users, friends, thoughts, and reactions via post requests. Once they have obtained their respective IDs, a user can update their own information or a thought through a put request. Using an ID, a user can also delete a user, friend, thought, or reaction via a delete request.

## Contribution
    
I gained a lot of information from the activities from my coding bootcamp. The activities I specifically used were module 18 activity 25 and the module 18 mini project. I also had a little assistance from my tutor Jacob Carver. 
  
## Tests
  
You can run the command "npm run watch" to use nodemon so you can keep the server running while you continue making changes without having to restart the server. Other than that there are no other tests for you to run.
